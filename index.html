        <h1><u><b>Structured Query Language</h1></u></b>
        <p class="para1">
            SQL stands for Structured Query Language is a standard database language that is used to create, maintain
            and retrieve data<br>
            from relational databases like MySQL, Oracle, SQL Server, PostGre, etc. The recent ISO standard version of
            SQL is SQL:2019.<br>
            As the name suggests, it is used when we have structured data (in the form of tables). <br>
            All databases that are not relational (or do not use fixed structure tables to store data) and therefore do
            not use SQL, are called NoSQL databases.<br>
            Examples of NoSQL are MongoDB, DynamoDB, Cassandra, etc.
        </p>
        <p class="para1">
            <b>These SQL commands are mainly categorized into five categories as:</b> <br><br>
            <b>1.DDL(Data Definition Language): </b> DDL or Data Definition Language actually consists of the SQL
            commands that can be used to define the<br>
            database schema. It simply deals with descriptions of the database schema and is used to create and
            modify<br>
            the structure of database objects in the database. DDL is a set of SQL commands used to create, modify,
            and<br>
            delete database structures but not data. These commands are normally not used by a general user, who
            should be accessing the database via an application.<br>
            <u><b>List of DDL commands:</b></u>
        <ul class="para1">
            <li><b>CREATE:</b> This command is used to create the database or its objects (like table, index, function,
                views,<br>
            <li>store procedure, and triggers).<br></li>
            <li><b>DROP: </b>This command is used to delete objects from the database.<br></li>
            <li><b>ALTER: </b>This is used to alter the structure of the database.<br></li>
            <li><b>TRUNCATE:</b> This is used to remove all records from a table, including all spaces allocated for the
                records<br>
                are removed.<br></li>
            <li><b>COMMENT:</b> This is used to add comments to the data dictionary.<br></li>
            <li><b>RENAME:</b> This is used to rename an object existing in the database.<br></li>
        </ul>
        <p class="para1">
            <b>2.DQL( Data Query Language): </b>DQL statements are used for performing queries on the data within schema
            objects. The purpose of the DQL<br>
            Command is to get some schema relation based on the query passed to it. We can define DQL as follows it is
            a<br>
            component of SQL statement that allows getting data from the database and imposing order upon it. It<br>
            includes the SELECT statement. This command allows getting the data out of the database to perform<br>
            operations with it. When a SELECT is fired against a table or tables the result is compiled into a
            further<br>
            temporary table, which is displayed or perhaps received by the program i.e. a front-end.<br>
            <u><b>List of DQLcommands:</b></u><br>
            <b>1.SELECT: It is used to retrieve data from the database.</b> <br><br><br>
        <p class="para1">
            <b>3.DML( Data Manipulation Language):</b> The SQL commands that deals with the manipulation of data present
            in the database belong to DML or Data<br>
            Manipulation Language and this includes most of the SQL statements. It is the component of the SQL
            statement<br>
            that controls access to data and to the database. Basically, DCL statements are grouped with DML
            statements.<br>
            <u><b>List of DML commands:</b></u>
        <ul class="para1">
            <li><b>INSERT:</b> It is used to insert data into a table.<br>
            <li><b>UPDATE:</b> It is used to update existing data within a table.<br>
            <li><b>DELETE:</b> It is used to delete records from a database table.<br><br></li>
            </u><br>
            <p class="para1">
                <b>4.DCL( Data Control Language):</b> DCL includes commands such as GRANT and REVOKE which mainly deal
                with the rights, permissions, and other<br>
                controls of the database system.<br>
                <u><b>List of DCL commands:</b></u>
            <ul class="para1">
                <li><b>GRANT:</b> This command gives users access privileges to the database.<br>
                <li><b>REVOKE:</b> This command withdraws the user's access privileges given by using the GRANT
                    command.<br>
                </li>
            </ul><br>
            <p class="para1">
                <b>5.TCL(Transaction Control Language):</b>Transactions group a set of tasks into a single execution
                unit. Each transaction begins with a specific
                task<br>
                and ends when all the tasks in the group successfully complete. If any of the tasks fail, the
                transaction<br>
                fails. Therefore, a transaction has only two results: success or failure. You can explore more about<br>
                transactions here. Hence, the following TCL commands are used to control the execution of a
                transaction:<br>
            <ul class="para1">
                <li><b>BEGIN:</b> Opens a Transaction.<br></li>
                <li><b>COMMIT:</b> Commits a Transaction.<br></li>
                <li><b>ROLLBACK:</b> Rollbacks a transaction in case of any error occurs.<br></li>
                <li><b>SAVEPOINT:</b> Sets a save point within a transaction.<br></li>
                <li><b>SET TRANSACTION:</b> Specifies characteristics for the transaction.<br></li>
            </ul> <br></b>
