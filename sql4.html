            <h1>PL/SQL - Overview </h1>
        </u>
        <p class="para1">
            The PL/SQL programming language was developed by Oracle Corporation in the late 1980s as procedural<br>
            extension language for SQL and the Oracle relational database. Following are certain notable facts about
            PL/SQL -<br>
            PL/SQL is a completely portable, high-performance transaction-processing language.
            PL/SQL provides a built-in, interpreted and OS independent programming environment.<br>
            PL/SQL can also directly be called from the command-line SQL*Plus interface.
            Direct call can also be made from external programming language calls to database.<br>
            PL/SQL's general syntax is based on that of ADA and Pascal programming language.
            Apart from Oracle, PL/SQL is available in TimesTen in-memory database and IBM DB2.<br>
            SQL is the standard database language and PL/SQL is strongly integrated with SQL. PL/SQL supports both
            static and dynamic SQL.<br>
            Static SQL supports DML operations and transaction control from PL/SQL block. In Dynamic SQL, SQL allows
            embedding DDL statements in PL/SQL blocks.<br>
            PL/SQL allows sending an entire block of statements to the database at one time. <br>This reduces network
            traffic and provides high performance for the applications.
            PL/SQL gives high productivity to programmers as it can query, transform, and update data in a database.<br>
            PL/SQL saves time on design and debugging by strong features, such as exception handling, encapsulation,
            data hiding, and object-oriented data types.<br>
            Applications written in PL/SQL are fully portable.PL/SQL provides access to predefined SQL packages.<br>
            PL/SQL provides support for Object-Oriented Programming.PL/SQL provides support for developing Web
            Applications and Server Pages.PL/SQL provides high security level.<br>

                <h1>PL/SQL - Basic Syntax </h1>
            </u>
        <p class="para1">
            <b>1.Declarations: </b>This section starts with the keyword DECLARE. <br>
            It is an optional section and defines all variables, cursors, subprograms, and other elements to be used in
            the program.<br>
            <b>2.Executable Commands: </b>This section is enclosed between the keywords BEGIN and END and it is a
            mandatory section.<br>
            It consists of the executable PL/SQL statements of the program.<br>
            It should have at least one executable line of code, which may be just a NULL command to indicate that
            nothing should be executed.<br>
            <b>3.Exception Handling: </b>his section starts with the keyword EXCEPTION.<br>
            This optional section contains exception(s) that handle errors in the program.<br><br>

                <h1>PL/SQL - Procedures </h1>
            </u>
        <p class="para1">
            A subprogram is a program unit/module that performs a particular task. These subprograms are combined to
            form larger programs. This is basically called the 'Modular design'.<br>
            A subprogram can be invoked by another subprogram or program which is called the calling program.<br>
            <b>A subprogram can be created -</b><br>
            ->At the schema level.<br>
            ->Inside a package.<br>
            ->Inside a PL/SQL block.<br>
            At the schema level, subprogram is a standalone subprogram. It is created with the CREATE PROCEDURE or the
            CREATE FUNCTION statement. <br>
            It is stored in the database and can be deleted with the DROP PROCEDURE or DROP FUNCTION statement.<br>
            A subprogram created inside a package is a packaged subprogram. It is stored in the database and can be
            deleted only when the package is<br>
            deleted with the DROP PACKAGE statement. We will discuss packages in the chapter 'PL/SQL - Packages'.<br>

                <h1>Creating a Procedure</h1>
            </u>
        <p class="para1">
            A procedure is created with the CREATE OR REPLACE PROCEDURE statement.The simplified syntax<br> for the
            CREATE OR REPLACE PROCEDURE statement is as follows -<br><br>
            <b>CREATE [OR REPLACE] PROCEDURE procedure_name <br>
                [(parameter_name [IN | OUT | IN OUT] type [, ...])] <br>

                    END procedure_name;

        <p class="para1">
            The syntax to create this procedure is same as we have done in previous example, the only difference is that
            it will get<br>
            stored at the back end and can be called anytime and anywhere.<br>A stored procedure can be called in two
            ways -<br>
            1.Using the EXECUTE keyword.<br>2.Calling the name of the procedure from a PL/SQL block<br>
            <b>The above procedure named 'greetings' can be called with the EXECUTE keyword as -</b><br>
            <b>EXECUTE greetings;</b><br>
            <b>The above call will display -</b><br>
            Hello World<br>
            PL/SQL procedure successfully completed.<br>
            <b>The procedure can also be called from another PL/SQL block -</b><br>
            BEGIN <br>
            greetings; <br>
            END; <br>

                <h1>PL/SQL - Functions</h1>
            </u>
        <p class="para1">
            In this chapter, we will discuss the functions in PL/SQL. A function is same as a procedure except that it
            returns a value. <br>Therefore, all the discussions of the previous chapter are true for functions too.<br>
            <u>
                <h1>Creating a Function</h1>
            </u>
        <p class="para1">
            A standalone function is created using the CREATE FUNCTION statement. The simplified syntax for the CREATE
            OR REPLACE PROCEDURE statement is as follows -<br><br>
            CREATE [OR REPLACE] FUNCTION function_name <br>
            [(parameter_name [IN | OUT | IN OUT] type [, ...])] <br>
            RETURN return_datatype <br>
            {IS | AS} <br>
            BEGIN <br>
            < function_body> <br>
                END [function_name];<br>
                <h2>Example</h2>
                <p class="para1">
                    CREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION totalCustomers<br>
                    RETURN number IS <br>
                    total number(2) := 0; <br>
                    BEGIN <br>
                    SELECT count(*) into total FROM customers; <br>
                    RETURN total; <br>
                    END; <br>
                    / <br>
                    When the above code is executed using the SQL prompt, it will produce the following result -<br>
                    <b>Function created.</b><br>
                    <u>
                        <h1>Calling a Function</h1>
                    </u>
                <p class="para1">
                    While creating a function, you give a definition of what the function has to do. To use a
                    function,<br>
                    you will have to call that function to perform the defined task. When a program calls a function,
                    the program control is transferred to the called function.<br>
                    A called function performs the defined task and when its return statement is executed or when
                    the<br>
                    last end statement is reached, it returns the program control back to the main program.<br>

                    To call a function, you simply need to pass the required parameters along with the function name and
                    if the function returns a value, <bR>
                    then you can store the returned value. Following program calls the function totalCustomers from an
                    anonymous block -<br><br>
                    DECLARE <br>
                    c number(2); <br>
                    BEGIN <br>
                    c := totalCustomers(); <br>
                    dbms_output.put_line('Total no. of Customers: ' || c); <br>
                    END; <br>
                    /<br>
                    When the above code is executed at the SQL prompt, it produces the following result âˆ’<br>
                    <b>Total no. of Customers: 6 <br>
