            <h1>PL/SQL - Cursors</h1>
        </u>
        <p class="para1">
            A cursor is a pointer to this context area. PL/SQL controls the context area through a cursor. A cursor
            holds the rows<br>
            (one or more) returned by a SQL statement. The set of rows the cursor holds is referred to as the active
            set.<br>
            You can name a cursor so that it could be referred to in a program to fetch and process the rows returned by
            the SQL statement, one at a time.<br>
            <b>There are two types of cursors -<br>
                1.Implicit cursors<br>
                2.Explicit cursors</b><br>
            <u>
                <h1>Implicit Cursors</h1>
            </u>
        <p class="para1">
            Implicit cursors are automatically created by Oracle whenever an SQL statement is executed, when there is no
            explicit cursor<br>
            for the statement. Programmers cannot control the implicit cursors and the information in it.Whenever a DML
            statement<br>
            (INSERT, UPDATE and DELETE) is issued, an implicit cursor is associated with this statement. For INSERT
            operations, the cursor holds the data that needs<br>
            to be inserted. For UPDATE and DELETE operations, the cursor identifies the rows that would be affected.<br>
            In PL/SQL, you can refer to the most recent implicit cursor as the SQL cursor, which always has attributes
            such as %FOUND, %ISOPEN, %NOTFOUND, and %ROWCOUNT.<br>
            The SQL cursor has additional attributes, %BULK_ROWCOUNT and %BULK_EXCEPTIONS, designed for use with the
            FORALL statement.<br>
            The following table provides the description of the most used attributes -<br>
            <b>1.%FOUND: </b>Returns TRUE if an INSERT, UPDATE, or DELETE statement affected one or more rows or a<br>
            SELECT INTO statement returned one or more rows. Otherwise, it returns FALSE.<br>
            <b>2.%NOTFOUND: </b>The logical opposite of %FOUND. It returns TRUE if an INSERT, UPDATE, or DELETE
            statement<br>
            affected no rows, or a SELECT INTO statement returned no rows. Otherwise, it returns FALSE.<br>
            <b>3.%ISOPEN:</b>Always returns FALSE for implicit cursors,because Oracle closes the SQL cursor
            automatically after executing its associated SQL statement.<br>
            <b>4.%ROWCOUNT:</b>Returns the number of rows affected by an INSERT, UPDATE, or DELETE statement, or
            returned by a SELECT INTO statement.<br>
        <h2>Example</h2>
        <p class="para1">
            <b> DECLARE <br>
                total_rows number(2); <br>
                BEGIN <br>
                UPDATE customers <br>
                SET salary = salary + 500; <br>
                IF sql%notfound THEN <br>
                dbms_output.put_line('no customers selected'); <br>
                ELSIF sql%found THEN <br>
                total_rows := sql%rowcount;<br>
                dbms_output.put_line( total_rows || ' customers selected '); <br>
                END IF; <br>
                END; <br>
                / </b> <br>
            When the above code is executed at the SQL prompt, it produces the following result -,<br>

                <h1>Explicit Cursors</h1>
            </u>
        <p class="para1">
            Explicit cursors are programmer-defined cursors for gaining more control over the context area. An explicit
            cursor should be defined in the declaration section of the PL/SQL Block. <br>
            It is created on a SELECT Statement which returns more than one row.<br><b>The syntax for creating an
                explicit cursor is -<br>
                CURSOR cursor_name IS select_statement; </b>
            <u>
                <h1>Declaring the Cursor</h1>
            </u>
        <p class="para1">
            Declaring the cursor defines the cursor with a name and the associated SELECT statement. For example -<br>
            <b>CURSOR c_customers IS SELECT id, name, address FROM customers;</b> <br>
            <u>
                <h1>Opening the Cursor</h1>
            </u>
        <p class="para1">
            Opening the cursor allocates the memory for the cursor and makes it ready for fetching the rows returned by
            the SQL statement into it. <br>
            For example, we will open the above defined cursor as follows -<br>
            <b>OPEN c_customers;</b> <br>
            <u>
                <h1>Fetching the Cursor</h1>
            </u>
        <p class="para1">
            Fetching the cursor involves accessing one row at a time. For example, we will fetch rows from the
            above-opened cursor as follows -<br>
            <b>FETCH c_customers INTO c_id, c_name, c_addr;</b><br>
            <u>
                <h1>Closing the Cursor</h1>
            </u>
        <p class="para1">
            Closing the cursor means releasing the allocated memory. For example, we will close the aboveopened cursor
            as follows -<br>
            <b>CLOSE c_customers;</b><br>
        <h2>Example</h2>
        <p class="para1">

                BEGIN <br>
                OPEN c_customers; <br>

                FETCH c_customers into c_id, c_name, c_addr;<br>
                EXIT WHEN c_customers%notfound; <br>
                dbms_output.put_line(c_id || ' ' || c_name || ' ' || c_addr); <br>
                END LOOP; <br>
                CLOSE c_customers; <br>

            </u>
        <p class="para1">
            An exception is an error condition during a program execution. PL/SQL supports programmers to catch such
            conditions using EXCEPTION block in the program<br>
